# typesetter-toy
experiments with fake typesetting rules with a real (bad) bitmap font. 
file under "pedagogy projects".

After many trials completely unrelated to the scope of the project,
this 'hello world' project should be 100% complete and function perfectly well as a static page / site.

If you like the font and want lowercase/punctuation gamut and proper character widths, 
or just want to know why I made something so gratuitiously ugly, hit me up :)
